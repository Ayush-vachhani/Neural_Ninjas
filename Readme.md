# Deepfake Detection System

## Overview

Deepfakes, a form of synthetic media, use AI to create deceptively realistic but fabricated videos or images. They pose significant risks, often used for malicious purposes like spreading misinformation or damaging reputations.

## Proposed Solution

We propose a robust deep learning-based solution to detect deepfakes. Our system utilizes:

* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**  Extract image/video features.
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Classify features as real or fake.

## Expected Benefits

* **Protection:**  Safeguard individuals from the harmful effects of deepfakes.
* **Content Integrity:** Help preserve the trustworthiness of online information.

## Method

**Approach**

We build upon the strengths of frame-by-frame classification using EfficientNet B7 encoders and MTCNN face detection, while introducing our own innovations to boost accuracy and robustness.

**Key Elements**

* **Model Architecture:**  
    * Base: Convolutional Neural Network with EfficientNet B7 encoders (pre-trained for superior image classification).
    * Fine-tuning: Customize the model with our enhanced dataset.
    * Experimentation: Explore various hyperparameters, architectures, and ensemble techniques.

* **MTCNN Face Detection:**  Focus analysis on facial features, a common target of deepfake manipulation.

* **Heavy Augmentations:** Artificially expand our training dataset with:
    * Temporal augmentations 
    * Adversarial training
    * Domain-specific augmentations

* **Custom Heuristic:**  Develop a heuristic to average frame-level predictions, taking into account confidence scores, temporal coherence, and neighboring frames.

* **Ensemble Learning:**  Investigate combining multiple models for improved accuracy and generalization.
